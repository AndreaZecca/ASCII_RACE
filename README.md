# ASCII_RACE
A simple C++ car game made in ASCII-Art. 

+ Computer science project for Unibo 

+  The game is score-based and implements a gradual difficulty.
  
+ You can lose score by hitting obstacoles who run towards you, or you can increase
  your score by taking power ups. The more score you get, the higher level you reach.
  
+ It is possible to choose three different difficulties: easy, normal and hard. The difficulty
  will affect the damages and the number of enemies on-screen.
